  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    SophyPets & Retreats founded in 2025, started with a simple abandoned and homeless pets. We began as a small group of volunteers rescuing stray animals that has grown into a community organization that has helped over 2,000 pets find their forever homes.

  <p>
    We believe adoption is more than just bringing a pet into your home; it’s about building lifelong companionship and love. Each adoption is guided by our core values of compassion, responsibility, and care.
